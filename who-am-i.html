          <h1>Giovanni Bondioli</h1>
          <p>I would love to live like the river flows, carried by the surprise of its own unfolding. - John O’Donohue
          I am a graphic artist, with an proficiency in design and illustration. I graduated from the Savannah College of Art and Design with a degree in Graphic Design, my work is a mixture of my admiration of art and design with my devotion to illustration.
          I am always trying to come up with new ideas and narratives for illustrations and designs. This is because I love to create, I am influenced and inspired by music and films, people I meet and other inspiring artist. I wish to affect everyone differently. Sometimes we need to open our minds to possibility beyond limitations. I want to show experiences unknown or overlooked, which can happen through many social and cultural barriers.
